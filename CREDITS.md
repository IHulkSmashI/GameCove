# Credits

GameCove stands on a lot of other people's work. Thank you.

## People

- **Kisenir** (r/MSIClaw): found and tested how to bring up the MSI Claw 8 EX gyro on Linux (sensor-hub firmware, HID-BPF descriptor fix, keepalive and bias calibration). He gave us permission to use his work (2026-11-08). His HID-BPF program is GPL-2.0-only; his helper scripts are GPL-2.0-or-later once he confirms.
- **HHHHanasak1**: xess-xmx-linux, XeSS on the XMX cores under Proton.
